# Battle.net Agent lab — private, bounded Windows observation

This repository is separate from the WoW downloader Lab and from the user's game.
It requests **no account login, no game installation/download, no repair, no CASC
writes, no anti-cheat changes and no TLS interception**.

## Initial experiment

A manual run or a push changing the lab's scripts/tests/workflow starts one
`windows-2025` GitHub-hosted job (8-minute maximum). It:

1. Refuses self-hosted runners, non-Windows systems and preexisting Battle.net state.
2. Downloads the bootstrapper from an official HTTPS endpoint with an allowlisted
   redirect chain and a 128 MiB installer-body cap.
3. Requires a valid Windows Authenticode signature and an expected Blizzard publisher
   before executing it. No certificate validation is disabled.
4. Launches the normal setup program **without guessed silent/EULA flags or GUI
   clicks**, with a reduced environment excluding GitHub/account credentials.
5. Observes for up to about 150 seconds: known process names/PIDs, sampled public TCP
   destinations, bounded file metadata and log **keyword counts only**.
6. Attempts to stop observed setup/Agent processes. The hosted VM is disposable.
7. Exports only one strictly validated JSON report; no binaries, screenshots,
   packet captures, raw logs, command lines, account/geoip values or user files.

A separate clean Linux job (4-minute maximum) revalidates the JSON and commits it to
`reports/latest.json` and `reports/run-<id>-<attempt>.json`. The observation job has
only `contents: read`; only the clean publication job has `contents: write`.
All external Actions are pinned to full commit SHAs (`action-pins.json`).
No schedule, background persistence or automatic retry is configured. Private
repository Actions minutes/storage are subject to the account's quota; no purchase
or paid runner is configured. A run may be queued/blocked by account policy/quota.

## Important limits

- Windows hosted runners are not an interactive consumer Windows desktop. If setup
  waits for interaction or does not expose an Agent process, the report says so;
  installation completion is **not** inferred. No login or UI interaction is added
  automatically to get past that limit.
- Time, download-body and output limits are separate: the **128 MiB cap applies to
  the fetched installer only**, not the bootstrapper's own subsequent network use.
  Its observation window/job timeout are bounded; there is no hard child-network
  byte cap in this initial experiment.
- Sampled TCP destinations are not full network capture or evidence of plaintext
  HTTP bodies. Log keyword occurrences do not prove an operation executed.
- A process may start/exit between samples. No Agent observed is not proof of absence.
- A fresh hosted VM isolates this experiment from user machines; it is **not** a
  security sandbox against malicious code. Only a signed expected publisher's
  bootstrapper is executed. No account or repository secrets are configured here.
- This first experiment is a bootstrap investigation, **not reverse-engineering of
  the full WoW update/patch/activation algorithm**. A real version-to-version update
  with game data needs a different, sufficiently large disposable Windows machine.
- Results must not be mixed with the separate Wow.exe telemetry study.

## Current downloader work continues independently

Keep the existing `WoW-Downloader-Lab`. Do not repeat metadata preparation/full
payload verification or start the broad conditional download queue. The current
TagFix update-scope report is evidence, not installation authorization or an exact
network download estimate.
